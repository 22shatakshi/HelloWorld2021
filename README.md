# VibeCheck
It is a program based in python that does sentiment analysis on user text and also plots the analysis on a graph so you can see a visual representation of the data.
The user can enter their own text that they want to analyze or they are allowed to pull tweets from twitter by providing the username for the account they want to pull tweets from.

The frontend is made using the flask framework in python.
The backend uses the the TextBlob Library for sentiment analysis, the Tweepy Library for calling the Twitter API and pulling tweets, and the MatPlotLib for plotting the analyzed data.
